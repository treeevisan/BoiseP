## **Web Scrape BOT**

This bot runs with Selenium Lib, interacting with JS web elements. One step is performed with pyautogui because Selenium wasn't performing the action. 

- If you would like to run this bot in your machine keep in mind that you may have to change the mouse coordinates at *Calendar* step
